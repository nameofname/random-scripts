 * Problem defitition : 

You are given an n x n binary matrix grid. You are allowed to change at most one 0 to be 1.
Return the size of the largest island in grid after applying this operation.
An island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1s.

 * @return {number}
 * Updated solution is much more efficient, but still not fast enough.
